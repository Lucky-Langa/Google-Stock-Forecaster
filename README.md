## **Key Learnings**
- **📉 Stationarity & ARIMA:** The ARIMA model performs best when the dataset is **stationary and properly normalized**, highlighting the importance of rigorous pre-processing.
- **📊 Feature Importance in Linear Regression:** While **Linear Regression** is a simpler model, its predictive power improves significantly with **well-engineered features**.

## **🏁 Conclusion**
After evaluating both **ARIMA and Linear Regression models**, the performance metrics—**📏 Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**—reveal that **Linear Regression outperformed ARIMA in this scenario**.  
This suggests that, for this dataset:
- 🎯 **Feature engineering played a more crucial role** in improving predictive accuracy.
- 🔁 **ARIMA's reliance on autoregressive dependencies** may not have captured the patterns as effectively as Linear Regression did.

💡 **Next Steps:** Future model refinements, residual analysis, and exploring hybrid deep learning approaches could further enhance forecasting accuracy.
